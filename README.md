# Digital-Light-Bulb
Description:
This project simulates a toggleable light bulb using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can click a switch to turn the light bulb on or off.
# How it Works:
1.Visual Setup: HTML creates the light bulb's structure (wire, bulb, switch) with Font Awesome icons.

2.Styled States: CSS styles the light bulb and switch, including "on" and "off" appearances.

3.Toggle Logic: JavaScript adds an event listener to the switch. Clicking the switch toggles a CSS class on the bulb (changing its appearance) and updates the switch's icon.
